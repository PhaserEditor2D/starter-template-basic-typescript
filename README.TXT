Dear user!

This project is configured to be coded with TypeScript.
It does not include the compiled JavaScript file, so it
does not run until you compile it.

To compile the project, follow these steps:

1- Install TypeScript.

2- Run the TypeScript compiler:

    $ tsc

A new game.js file will be created. Then the project
is ready. You can play it.

Phaser Editor 2D does not include any
TypeScript tooling. We recommend using a third-party
editor like Visual Studio Code to write the TypeScript code.

If you have any issue, send us an email to:
    
    developers@phasereditor2d.com

or file an issue at:

    https://github.com/PhaserEditor2D/PhaserEditor2D-v3/issues

Happy coding!
